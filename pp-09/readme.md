## ITMD 361, Production Problem 9: GitHub Pull Requests

For this Production Problem, you and your group are going to establish your group and individual repositories for Project 3, and practice submitting a pull request.

1. Choose one member who’s GitHub account will contain the group repository. Create it on that member’s local computer, along with an empty `README.md` file. Set up the remote repository, and push the initial commit containing the empty `README.md` file.

Write the name of your group members here:

Write the URL for your shared repository here:

2. Each member of the group should fork the repository (including the group member who’s account contains the group repository).

Write the URL for your personal repository here:

3. Each member of the group should clone their forked copy of the repository to his/her computer. Once you have cloned the forked copy, you should add the *group* repository as a second remote. Run `git remote add group` followed by the URL for your group’s repository.

Write the output of `git remote -v` from your copy of the forked repository here:

4. Finally, each group member should add to the `README.md` file his/her name, and a brief few sentences of what the member believes are his/her primary strengths. Prior to doing that, be sure to pull from the remote repo (`git pull group master`) to get any other group members’ names and strengths. Add and commit your own work, and push to your own repository (`git push origin master`).

5. From within your copy of the repository on GitHub, open up a pull request. Each group member should review the request before it is merged, and then pull from the group repository to have a complete, up-to-date `README.md` file.

Write the URL of your pull request here:
