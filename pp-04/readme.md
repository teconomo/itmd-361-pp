## ITMD 361, Production Problem 4: Typographic Scales

For this production problem, go to http://www.modularscale.com/ and choose a modular scale that you
think is appropriate for setting a text-heavy page in index.html at mobile scale (for small
screens). Write your styles in the screen.css file (obviously).

Pay special attention to inter-line spacing (`line-height`) and setting the spaces between
paragraphs, short list items, and list items containing multiple paragraphs. Be sure also to add
some spacing between the text and the edges of the viewport.

Be sure, of course, to use only em units in your stylesheet.
