## ITMD 361, Production Problem 5: The JavaScript Console

This production problem asks you to get familiar with the JavaScript console in Firefox Developer Edition, as well as the JavaScript console/REPL in Node.js. For each of the prompts below, you’ll need to do a screen capture of your browser or of Node.js running in the terminal window. You’ll then add and commit those screenshots to your PP repository. Do a Google search for how to capture just the active window in your operating system of choice.

1. Open Firefox Developer Edition and go to `about:blank`. Then, figure out how to open the JavaScript console (called the Web Console in Firefox). Take a screenshot of it open.

2. Figure out how to move the JavaScript console to the righthand of the screen, with Responsive Design View open to a mobile-sized viewport. Take a screenshot.

3. Use the JavaScript console to figure out how many seconds are in a year, using a JavaScript mathematical expression. Take a screenshot showing your work, and the returned result.

4. Open your terminal and run the command `node` to fire up the Node.js REPL/console. Run the command `.help` to see a list of other commands for the Node REPL. Take a screenshot.

5. Finally, close the Node REPL by typing the command `.exit`.
