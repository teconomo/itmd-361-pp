## ITMD 361, Production Problem 8: jQuery and the Global Namespace

Open the `site.js` file in this directory, and rewrite its use of jQuery so that jQuery no longer controls the `$` variable in the global namespace (`window.$`) while allowing the script as written to continue to use `$`. Hint: you might want to load up the `index.html` file in your browser with `http-server` so you can use Firefox Developer Editionâ€™s JavaScript console to assist your revisions.
